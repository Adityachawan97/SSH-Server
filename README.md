# Project Title :boom:
SSH-Server Autorun Script

<br/>

# Motivation :heart:
To get rid of the hassle of connecting the Raspberry-Pi to an external monitor using wired connections and reduce wired mess.

<br/>

# Description :smiley:
When connecting the Raspberry-Pi running Kali Linux to an external monitor many wired connections like a HDMI to VGA connector are required and the whole process of connection is somewhat troublesome. In order to connect headlessly to the operating system being run on the Raspberry-Pi it would be a good consideration to use some wireless channel to connect. This script does the same job in an automated way and provides the end user comfort to sit back and relax.
